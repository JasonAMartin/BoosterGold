1. Update DB data_updated when new title or issue is added so I can easily see what's new.
2. Need to make a cleanup script that finds 10k or under images and reports for replacement.
3. Now that I have image response code, I need a way to re-try downloads.

BUGS:
1. fix update_log.txt location. When I CD (like fixing files, update_log ends up in other dirs)
